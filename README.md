# Chuck Norris Jokes

This app serves as a playground where I play with various React and JavaScript patterns.  
Currently, I am comparing the render props pattern used by libraries such as React Router and React Motion with higher order component pattern used by everybody else.

## Demo

Demo URL [chuck-norris-jokes11.firebaseapp.com](https://chuck-norris-jokes11.firebaseapp.com/)

## Usage

- `yarn` (installs the dependencies)
- `yarn start` (starts the app)
- `yarn build` (builds the app)

This app uses [api.chucknorris.io](https://api.chucknorris.io) API to get the jokes.
